## Design and implementation


### Resources and settings

This section explains ModusToolbox&trade; resources and their configurations used in this code example. Note that all the configuration explained in this section has already been done in the code example. ModusToolbox&trade; stores the device configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file and Bluetooth&reg; configuration settings of the application in the *design.cybt* file. This file uses the graphical configurators, which generate the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application’s *GeneratedSource* folder.

- **Device Configurator:** Used to enable or configure the peripherals and the pins used in the application. For detailed information on how to use it, see the [Device Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig).

- **Bluetooth&reg; Configurator:** Used to generate or modify the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database. For detailed information on how to use it, see the [Bluetooth&reg; Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig).

This application demonstrates the Bluetooth&reg; LE peripheral capability of the supported kit. The XENSIV&trade; Sensor Shield sensor values are sent over Bluetooth&reg; LE to a central device (Infineon Sensor Hub mobile app), and to the UART as debug trace messages. This project demonstrates the following features:

- Bluetooth&reg; LE BMI270 Sensing Service – GATT read and notify functionality
- Debug trace messages
- Connection with a central device
- Connection status indication through LED

The project consists of the following files:

**Table 1. User-application-related source files**

File name | Description
-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------
*main.c* | Contains the `main()` function, which is the entry point for execution of the user application code after device startup.
*cycfg_bt_settings.c, cycfg_bt_settings.h* | Contain the runtime Bluetooth&reg; stack configuration parameters such as device name and  advertisement/ connection settings. Note that the name that the device uses for advertising ("bmi270") is defined in the *app_bt_cfg.c* file.
*app_bt_gatt_handler.c, app_bt_gatt_handler.h* | Contain the code for the Bluetooth&reg; stack GATT event handler functions.
*cycfg_gatt_db.c, cycfg_gatt_db.h* | Contain the GATT database information generated using the Bluetooth&reg; configurator tool. These files reside in the *GeneratedSource* folder under the application folder.
*sensor_task.c, sensor_task.h* | Contain the RTOS task and functions needed to initialize the BMI270 sensor and read from it.


#### Flowchart

**Figure 17. Bluetooth&reg; LE BMI270 sensing service application**
   
<img src="./images/fig11.flowchart.png" alt="BMI270 - flow chart" height="700"/>

This flowchart provides an overview of the BMI270 bluetooth application. The BMI270 sensing profile in this application consists of one of the Bluetooth&reg; SIG-defined services. This project implements a custom characteristic named `BMI270` from a custom service named `XENSIV Sensor Shield`. This characteristic supports notification and read operations, which allow the GATT server to send data to the connected GATT client device whenever new data is available and a read to be performed from the GATT client device. 

The "BMI270" characteristic contains a single byte value, which contains the latest board orientation based on readings from the BMI270. **Table 2** shows the possible orientations and values associated with each orientation.

**Table 2. Board orientation values**

Value | Board orientation
---------|---------------------
 `0x00` | N/A
 `0x01` | Top edge
 `0x02` | Bottom edge
 `0x03` | Left edge
 `0x04` | Right edge
 `0x05` | Display up
 `0x06` | Display down

The Bluetooth&reg; Configurator provided by ModusToolbox&trade; makes it easier to design and implement the GATT DB. The Bluetooth&reg; Configurator generates the *cycfg_gatt_db.c* and *cycfg_gatt_db.h* files. All custom sensing profile-related variables and functions are contained in these files. When the GATT DB is initialized after Bluetooth&reg; stack initialization, all profile-related values will be ready to be advertised to the central device. See the [ModusToolbox&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Configurator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig) for details.

The code example reads the x, y, and z values from the BMI270 sensor every second. After one second, `mtb_bmi270_read` API is called to read the data. A return code of `CY_RSLT_SUCCESS` indicates a successful read. A return code of `-1` indicates sensor data is not ready, so a retry is attempted after a second. After a successful read, the x, y, and z values are compared against one another to determine the estimated board orientation. This orientation is then sent to a Bluetooth&reg; Low Energy connected central device once GATT notifications are enabled by the central.

When the peripheral device is connected, the "USER LED2" will be ON; when it is disconnected but still advertising, the "USER LED2" will toggle; when it is disconnected and no longer advertising, the "USER LED2" will be OFF. To turn the LED ON and OFF, generic GPIO functions are used to drive the output pin HIGH or LOW. The LEDs present in the supported kits are active LOW LEDs, which means that the LED turns ON when the GPIO is driven LOW.

The *app_bt_gatt_handler.c* and *app_bt_gatt_handler.h* files handle the functionality of GATT callbacks from the central device. On receiving a connection request, the Bluetooth&reg; stack gives a GATT event to the application of the `wiced_bt_gatt_evt_t` type.

In *cycfg_bt_settings.c*, all the runtime Bluetooth&reg; stack configuration parameters are defined; these will be initialized during Bluetooth&reg; stack initialization. Some of the configurations include the device name, connection interval, advertisement interval, advertisement channels to use, number of client connections, and maximum transmission unit (MTU). You also have the flexibility to configure the buffer pool size, which helps optimize the memory and transmission rate depending on the application use case.

The project also contains *app_bt_utils.c* and *app_bt_utils.h*, which provide APIs to see meaningful messages in debug logs in the debug UART. Most of the status messages in Bluetooth&reg; stack are represented in enumerated values. These functions allow you to view the respective strings instead of the enumerated values.

This application uses a modified *FreeRTOSConfig.h* file to work. Here, the `configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY` is changed to **6** for the timer task and `configTIMER_TASK_STACK_DEPTH` is changed to **256**. In addition, two other minor modifications are made to the default *FreeRTOSConfig.h* file.
